## Contribution Opportunities

Documented failure cases are valuable inputs for improving TaxonoPy.
Contributions may include:

* documenting additional failure patterns
* proposing secondary tie-breaking heuristics
* extending existing resolution profiles
* adding dataset-specific disambiguation rules

Clear documentation of *why* a resolution fails is often as important as
resolving it.

If you encounter recurring failure modes, consider opening an issue with:

* example UUIDs
* trace output
* GNVerifier results
* proposed resolution logic
